## Description

Many online communities rely on PGP signatures and the ownership of the private key as a means to prove who the sender of a message is.

That is, as long as the private key is not leaked, you can be confident that who you are chatting with is the rightful owner of the public/private PGP key pair.

_Vapour_ enables end-to-end encrypted communication where users are identified by their PGP public keys. 

## How it Works

Users use their PGP public key as an effective username for logging in. When messaging others, users reference the fingerprint of the other public key.

For a user to log in. the given steps must be completed:
 - Users are given a verification message (e.g. _Verification Challenge: a677a007-a410-4071-ba35-ef2a1b18fef1_) which they then must sign with their private key. Signing is done offline using whatever the user prefers.
 - Users then submit their public key and the clearsigned message (message + signature)
 - _Vapour_ then carries out the following steps:
     - Checks the current challenge is valid and unsolved. To prevent replay attacks.
     - Verifies that the PGP signature was generated by the user's public key
     - If the signature is verified then a cookie is handed back to the browser
     - The user is then sent to the conversation page to chat with other users

User's can then use the fingerprint of another user's public key to initiate conversations with each other.
